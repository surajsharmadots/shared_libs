## 3️⃣ `LICENSE` — **CRITICALLY IMPORTANT (legally)**

This is the only file lawyers care about.  
And yes, lawyers can hurt you.

### What it does
- Defines **who can use your code**
- Determines if companies can legally depend on it
- Without it → **code is legally unusable**

If this is blank, your code is **“all rights reserved” by default**.

### Use MIT (don’t get creative)
